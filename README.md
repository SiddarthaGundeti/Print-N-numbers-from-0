# Print-N-numbers-from-0

Question Explanation:

The given program is tasked with printing a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at one less than a specified number N.

Logical Approach:

Read Input:
Capture the input, which is a single integer N.

Initialize Counter:
Set up a counter variable, starting at 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of printed values and to ensure that the loop runs N times.

Iterate and Print:
Use a while loop that runs as long as the counter is less than N.
In each iteration, print the current value of the counter.
After printing, increment the counter by 1 to move on to the next number.

Output:
Each line of output represents the current count, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 each time, until it reaches N-1.

Example for Clarity:

Suppose the input N is 5.
Starting from 0, the next numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4, which are less than 5.
Each of these numbers is printed on a new line.
The output will be:
0

1 

2

3

4
